Software dependencies
>>>>>>> 27dad82c5a443967d7b433791dcc747fe2282723
---------------------

We recommend the use of `pip <http://pip.openplans.org/>`_ for environment 
and dependency management in this and other Python projects. If you don't 
have them installed we recommend ``sudo apt-get install pip``.

Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^

The site was developed with the assumption it would be deployed to a server
running Apache with mod_wsgi and virtualenv as appropriate.  Likely it will
work under other configurations as needed for that enironment.

Install python dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>>>>>>> 27dad82c5a443967d7b433791dcc747fe2282723

Georgia Lynchings depends on several python libraries. The installation 
is mostly automated, and will print status messages as packages are 
installed. If there are any errors, pip should announce them very loudly.

All dependencies can be executed from a single pip install file::

  $ pip install -r pip-install-all.txt

Alternatively install and development requirements have been sperated
and are executed respectively as::

  $ pip install -r pip-install-req.txt

If you are a developer or are installing to a continuous ingration server
where you plan to run unit tests, code coverage reports, or build sphinx
documentation, you probably will also want to::

  $ pip install -r pip-dev-req.txt
