    <p>This site brings to light the terrible history of Lynching violence in the state of 
      Georgia circa 1875-1930.  Through a analysis of the newspaper articles reporting
      on these crimes, scholars have been attempting to express the complex network of 
      relationships between actors and classify the types of interactions expressed in reporting from that time.  Through analysis of the language used to report these events scholars hope to express the complexity of interactions related to these terrible events.</p>
