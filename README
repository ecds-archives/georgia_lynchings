Timemap
=======
Timemap is a Javascript library to help use online maps, including Google,
OpenLayers, and Bing, with a SIMILE timeline. The library allows you to
load one or more datasets in JSON, KML, or GeoRSS onto both a map and a timeline
simultaneously. By default, only items in the visible range of the timeline are
displayed on the map.
